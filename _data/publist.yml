  description: Can mesoscopic shot noise experiments show the doubling of the charge carriers in a superconductor? Turns out, it's complicated. We investigated this in several different samples, and made predictions as to what is necessary to make this work.

- title: "Puddle formation, persistent gaps, and non-mean-field breakdown of superconductivity in overdoped (Pb,Bi)2Sr2CuO6+δ"
  image: BSCCOgap.png
  description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.

  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.

  image: Direct.png
  authors: I Battisti, WO Tromp, S Riccò, RS Perry, AP Mackenzie, A Tamai, F Baumberger, MP Allan
  description: We directly test the consistency of results from these three techniques by comparing data from the correlated metal Sr2RhO4. Using ARPES, STM, and quantum oscillations, we find good agreement for the Fermi surface topography and carrier effective masses. Hence, the apparent absence of such an agreement in other quantum materials, including the cuprates, suggests that the electronic states in these materials are of different, non-Fermi liquid-like nature.
