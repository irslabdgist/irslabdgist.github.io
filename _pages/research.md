Our goal is to develop new sensing technologies to see the world from from entirely new perspective, leveraging <strong>Radio-Frequency Signals</strong>. By <strong>Integrating the Power of AI with Radio-Frequency Signal Processing</strong>---and further expanding these capabilities through <strong>Sensor Fusion</strong>---we aim to push the boundaries of human perceptual capabilities in diverse areas such as IoT, Health Monitoring, Autonomous Driving, Defense/Remote Sensing, and HCI.
