I am an Assistant Professor at Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, [DGIST](https://www.dgist.ac.kr/eng/index.do), Daegu, Korea, since 2024. 

From 2023 to 2024, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu/) (advised by Prof. [Amin Arbabian](https://arbabianlab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), Stanford, CA, US. I received the M.S. and Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/) (advised by Prof. [Kyung-Tae Kim](http://iras.postech.ac.kr/main/index.php)), Pohang, Korea, in 2019 and 2023, respectively. I completed the B.S. degree in Computer Science from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/sites/en/index.do), Seoul, Korea, in 2017.

My main research focuses on advanced radio sensing
interests lie in Wireless Sensing with Machine Learning, including intelligent radar signal processing, RF-based localization, crowd counting, contactless health monitoring, and SAR-based perception. I am also interested in the Computer Vision and Sensor Fusion algorithms.
